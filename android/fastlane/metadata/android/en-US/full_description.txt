FischTracker is a no-frills time tracker. If you ever went to bed wondering where your day disappeared, this app is for you. 
Configure categories and jobs (tasks), then toggle the timer when you move from one job to the next. 
FischTracker is designed for simplicity and ease of use. It focuses on productivity and time management. It aims to answer questions such as "How much time do I spend in management meetings?" or "Do I manage to divide my time equally between research and teaching?"

FischTracker is not suited for billing and accounting purposes.
